Sys/LoadAvg version 0.01
============================

I wrote Sys::LoadAvg sometime in 2002 before several other modules providing 
nearly the same functionality appeared on CPAN. At the time I created it, I was 
using it on Solaris, Linux, and iirc OpenBSD (though it may have been one of 
the other BSDs.) I haven't needed it on other platforms, but I'll add support
for them as the opportunity to test arises. 

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
